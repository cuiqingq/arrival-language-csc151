Author: Zoe Cui and Ivy Xu

Note: This code utilizes GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), Dr Racket, and some GIMP libraries and plugins that are designed primarily for teaching purporses by Grinnell CS faculty. If your device does not have the above, the program will not run. Here is an instruction on how to set one's machine up and contains GitHUb source codes links. Several test images are also included in ./examples.
